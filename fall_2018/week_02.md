## Last Week's Accomplishments

Still Learning basics of Javascript
Played around with the website and found out what features to work on.

## This Week's Plan

Trying to implment the feature, which is typing in location's name to 
get the camera to move to that location in the VR view.
## Anything Blocking?

Confusion on the technology.

## Notes

Might need help and will seek help to have basic idea of how the website work.
